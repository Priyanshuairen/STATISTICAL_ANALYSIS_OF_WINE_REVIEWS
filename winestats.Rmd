## CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING THE DATA

Preprocessing and data cleaning are crucial stages in ensuring the preparedness of the dataset for analysis. Preprocessing procedures for the "Wine Reviews" dataset may include addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and standardising data types. The following is an illustration of the preprocessing and cleaning procedures for data in the R programming language.

### CHECKING FOR MISSING VALUES
```{r}
# Check for missing values
missing_values <- colSums(is.na(wine_reviews))
print("Missing values per column:")
print(missing_values)
```
### DROPPING ROWS WITH EMPTY VALUES
```{r}
# Drop rows with missing values (if needed)
wine_reviews <- wine_reviews %>%
  drop_na()
```

 #### CHECKIING AND REMOVING DUPLICTAES
```{r}
# Check for and remove duplicates
wine_reviews <- wine_reviews %>%
  distinct()
```



#### CHECKING CLEANED DATA
```{r}
# Check the cleaned dataset
str(wine_reviews)  # View the structure of the cleaned dataset
head(wine_reviews)  # View the first few rows of the cleaned dataset
```
### CHECKING FOR OUTLIERS
The management of outliers is a crucial component of data preparation, as it serves the purpose of mitigating the impact of extreme or erroneous results on the analysis or machine learning models. There are several approaches to address outliers, including techniques such as winsorization, capping, or exclusion based on statistical criteria. This paper aims to illustrate the process of identifying and managing outliers by the use of a simple technique known as winsorization, which involves substituting outlier values with a predetermined percentile value.

```{r}
# Winsorize 'price' variable at the 1st and 99th percentiles
lower_percentile <- quantile(wine_reviews$price, 0.01)
upper_percentile <- quantile(wine_reviews$price, 0.99)

# Winsorize the 'price' variable
wine_reviews <- wine_reviews %>%
  mutate(winsorized_price = ifelse(price < lower_percentile, lower_percentile,
                                   ifelse(price > upper_percentile, upper_percentile, price)))

# Check the dataset with winsorized 'price'
summary(wine_reviews$winsorized_price)


# View the structure and first few rows of the updated dataset
str(wine_reviews)
head(wine_reviews)
```



#### RECHECKING OUTLIERS

```{r}
# Calculate quartiles and IQR for the 'price' variable
quartiles <- quantile(wine_reviews$price, probs = c(0.25, 0.75))
Q1 <- quartiles[1]
Q3 <- quartiles[2]
IQR <- Q3 - Q1

# Define the lower and upper bounds for outliers
lower_bound <- Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
upper_bound <- Q3 + 1.5 * IQR

# Identify outliers for 'price'
outliers_price <- wine_reviews %>% filter(price < lower_bound | price > upper_bound)

# Remove outliers from the dataset
cleaned_wine_reviews <- wine_reviews %>% filter(price >= lower_bound & price <= upper_bound)

# Summary of outliers and cleaning results
cat("Number of outliers in 'price':", nrow(outliers_price), "\n")
cat("Dataset size after removing outliers:", nrow(cleaned_wine_reviews), "\n")

# View the structure and first few rows of the cleaned dataset
str(cleaned_wine_reviews)
head(cleaned_wine_reviews)




```

  labs(title = "Price vs. Points", x = "Points", y = "Price")
```







### WHAT WE LEARNT FROM THE ABOVE VISUALIZATIONS

1. Distribution of Wine Points:

The analysis reveals that a significant proportion of wines obtained ratings ranging from 80 to 90 points, suggesting that a majority of the wines in question were evaluated favourably.\
The prevalence of wines with very low or high ratings seems to have diminished, indicating a reduced occurrence of both subpar and extraordinary wines.

2. Price Distribution:

The price distribution demonstrates that the majority of wines are situated within lower to moderate price brackets.\
A limited number of wines exhibit notably elevated pricing, indicating a relatively lower prevalence of pricey wines within the sample.

3. Top 10 Wine Varieties by Frequency:

The information reveals that the most often occurring wine varietals are Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Red Blend, suggesting their significant popularity and prevalence within the dataset.

4. Distribution of Wine Points by Wine Variety:

Every kind of wine has a distinct pattern of ratings throughout its many varieties. Certain kinds have a tendency towards higher average scores, whilst others show a greater dispersion of ratings.

5. Average Price by Country:

The mean price of wines exhibits variation among countries, suggesting that the price of wines may vary considerably depending on the location of production.\
Certain nations have a tendency towards higher-priced wines in comparison to their counterparts.

6. Price vs. Points Scatter Plot:

The scatter plot indicates a diverse correlation between wine ratings and pricing. The absence of a discernible linear association suggests that the price and rating of the wine do not consistently exhibit a direct correlation.

### LIMITATIONS OF STUDY

During the analysis of the wine dataset, there were several limitations that need to be acknowledged to provide a comprehensive understanding of the findings and conclusions:

Dataset Limitations:

The dataset might not represent the entire wine market globally; it's a sample, and therefore, conclusions drawn from it may not be fully generalizable.

Data Completeness:

The dataset might have missing or incomplete entries, especially in critical columns such as price and points, which could impact the accuracy and representativeness of the analysis.

Sampling Bias:

The dataset might have a bias towards specific wine varieties, countries, or wineries due to the way the data was collected, potentially impacting the generalizability of findings.

Time Sensitivity:

The dataset might be time-sensitive, with trends and preferences changing over time. The analysis might not reflect the current market situation if the data is not up to date.

Limited Attributes:

The dataset includes a limited number of attributes. Additional features like climate, soil type, and winemaking techniques could provide more comprehensive insights.

Variety Classification:

Wine varieties might be subject to interpretation or classification inconsistencies, affecting the accuracy of the analysis, particularly in understanding the relationship between variety and other attributes.

Price Currency:

The dataset may have prices in different currencies. Not accounting for this could introduce inaccuracies in price-related analyses.

Points Subjectivity:

Wine ratings (points) are subjective and could vary based on the reviewer's preferences, leading to potential biases in the analysis of wine quality.

Country Labeling:

The accuracy of country labels relies on the dataset's quality and sources. Mislabeling or inconsistent labeling can affect country-based analyses.

External Factors:

External factors like economic conditions, global events, or market trends might influence wine prices and consumer preferences, which are not accounted for in the dataset.

Statistical Assumptions:

The analyses made assumptions such as normality and homogeneity of variances, which may not hold true for the dataset and could impact the validity of the tests.



### CONCLUSION

In the present study, an examination of the wine dataset was undertaken, whereby a range of hypothesis tests and ANOVA comparisons were used to investigate many facets including wine kinds, countries, designations, prices, and points. Notwithstanding the inherent constraints in the dataset, the results yielded useful insights into the wine business.In summary, this research provides an initial framework for comprehending the intricacies of the wine business, facilitating well-informed decision-making among relevant parties. To enhance the comprehensiveness of our understanding of the wine business, it is recommended that future investigations use further data, take into account external influences, and address the shortcomings already acknowledged. The acquired insights have significant value in terms of pricing tactics, marketing endeavours, and overall market positioning within the wine industry.
